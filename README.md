# Privacy Metrics Survey: Supplementary Data

This repository contains the supplementary spreadsheet accompanying the paper  
**“How do we measure privacy in text? A survey of text anonymization metrics.”**

### Columns
- **Privacy Objective** – The high-level privacy goal targeted by the metric (Identifier Removal Effectiveness, Dataset Membership, Attribute Inference Risk, Reconstruction Attacks, Semantic Inference Risk, Theoretical Privacy Bounds).  
- **Paper** – Citation of the original publication.  
- **Dataset** – Dataset(s) used in the paper’s privacy evaluation.  
- **Anonymization Methods** – The anonymization or privacy-preserving techniques evaluated.  
- **Privacy Metrics** – Metric(s) used to quantify privacy protection in the text.  
- **Threat Model** – The assumed adversary capability or evaluation setup.  
- **Metric Limitations** – Limitations, caveats, or critiques discussed by the paper’s authors.


All information was extracted manually from the cited papers.  
The goal is to support transparency and future benchmarking efforts in text anonymization research.
